# Points

Points are going to be a new feature in the system. Each family member will be able to earn points. These will be shown next to the member's name in the family members page, calendar, and chore pages.

All UI will be responsive and work well on a smaller screens, especially a tablet.

# What awards points

Completing chores will be the main way to earn points. Chores will be updated to optionally assign points to them. When completed, the family member the chore was for will earn the points for them. If a chore is uncompleted, the points will be taken away from the family member so they cannot game the system.
Recurring chores can award points and the points are awarded each time the chore is completed.

# Ledger

We want to keep a ledger of how points are earned so it is clear the system is accurate.

# Values

The value of points will be completely arbitrary. It will be a positive integer value.

# Out of scope

* What is done with the points is currently out of scope. We are only adding an earning and tracking system at this step.
* Gamification or leaderboard
* Complex calculation mechanics like streaks or decay.
* Analytics, graphing trends

Chores is currently the only way to award and earn points. In the future, the system may offer manual awarding of points, but that will need to include some kind of authorization to ensure only parents are awarding points and not kids giving themselves as many points as they want.
